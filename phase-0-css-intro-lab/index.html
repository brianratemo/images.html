<h1 id="main-header">How does writing CSS differ from writing HTML?</h1>


      <p>As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:</p> 

   <u1>
    <li class="perspective-questions">Should we layout the text in asingle or double column?</li>
      <li class="perspective-questions">Should we use a different font color for the header?</li>
      <li class="perspective-questions">How should we very same content appear differently on a desktop vs. a mobile device?</li></u1>

<P>All of the questions above deal with esthetic and function considerations. 
    These are the perspectives of the presentational layer (CSS).</P>

    <p>Let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Does the oder of items withina list matter?Should it be a numbered list?</li>
        <li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
        <li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The last few questions deal with structure,hierarchy, and meaning.
        These are the perspectives of the content layer (HTML).</p>

        <p>When we CSS we focus on the esthetic and function considerations. When we write HTML we focus on structure,hierarchy,and meaning.</p>
